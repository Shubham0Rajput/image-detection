## Here we are taking the example of CAT and DOG, in which we will detect the photo given to it ##
Step 1. Prerequisite
---------------------------------
_Before everything, install these things on your system
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). 
* [Pictures of Cats And Dogs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U6RtBhML-Lj0w2suve0UhQmwcF5pfJCm/view). 
* [This Repository](https://github.com/Shubham0Rajput/image-detection/archive/master.zip)

### After Downloading  Anaconda Write these command into Anaconda Promt ###
* For installing Python
```
  conda install -c conda-forge python
```

* For installing OpenCV
```
  conda install -c conda-forge opencv
```

```
  conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

* For installing Tensorflow
```
  conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
```

* For installing Keras
```
  conda install -c conda-forge keras
```

Step 2. Running The code
---------------------------------
1. Open the Jupyter Lab (in the same Directory the the code.ipynb is trored)
```
jupyter notebook
```
2. Copy CATS_DOGS.zip and Extract it into the same folder where the Jupyter Notebook is opened 
3. Open the code.ipynb from Home Page of Jupyter Notebook
4. Press Shift+Enter to Run the code
